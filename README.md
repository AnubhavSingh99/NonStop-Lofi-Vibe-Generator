## 📝Description

Our project is an interactive web application that allows users to generate original Lofi music, play nonstop piano music, and experience music with visuals. The application integrates advanced machine learning models to provide a unique and immersive musical experience.

Key Features:

> Lofi Music Generation:

- Users can generate original Lofi music using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) through a latent space.The generated Lofi music is unique to each user session, providing endless possibilities for exploration and creativity.

> Nonstop Piano Music Playback:

- Users can enjoy nonstop piano music playback generated using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
  
> Music Experience with Visuals:
- The music experience page offers users the opportunity to immerse themselves in music accompanied by captivating visuals. The visuals are synchronized with the music, enhancing the overall listening experience. Users can choose from a variety of visual themes and effects to accompany the music, creating a visually stunning and dynamic environment.
